Simeon's Homebrew Calculations. 

*WARNING:* While I share this code it is clearly not even nearly ready 
to be used by anyone else and may never be. My main motivations for creating 
this were that I wanted a test project to learn some Python and I wanted to 
learn more about the brewing calculations.
